## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Why does the AI say "OpenAI Key Missing"?**
A: You need to put your API Key in `.env` or the Settings page. Without it, the app runs in "Local/Demo" mode with limited capability.

**Q: Can I run this on the cloud?**
A: Yes! The project includes a `Dockerfile`. You can deploy it to AWS, Azure, or Render easily.
